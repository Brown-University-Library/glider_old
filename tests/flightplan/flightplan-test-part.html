    <!-- PART CREATION AND INSTANTIATION 
    
        Parts are created implicitly every time a Phase is defined.
        This is because a Phase needs a "something" to turn off and on.

        If a Phase is defined, but a Part is not specified, the Part
        is simply a default "pass-through" or "identity" Part that 
        passes through the HTML contained. It will share the ID of the
        Phase.
      
      -->

    <div id="z1" phase-type="par">
      This is contained in an Identity Part with id #z1, and Phase #z1.
    </div>

    <!-- With the creation of a Phase container (i.e. PAR or SEQ)
        all children of that Phase container are themselves Parts
        (since each will have to be turned off and on)

        In the case of the children here (#z2 > *) the ID's are
        auto-generated.
    -->

    <ul id="z2" phase-type="seq">
      <li>This is a Phase, and therefore a Part</li>
      <li>This is also a Phase, and therefore also a Part</li>
      <li>This too is a Phase, and therefore this too is a Part</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- You can (of course) explicitly create a part by specifying
        a Part type and (optionally) a Part View -->


    <!-- PART TYPES AND VIEWS
      
        A Part has a Type and 0 or more Views

        The Type can be specified by:

          @part-type
          @part="<TYPE>" or
          classname part-<TYPE>

        If the View is not specified, then the Part uses its
        default View (as specified in the Part definition)

    -->

    <div id="a" part-type="typeA"></div>
    <div id="a2" part="typeA2"></div>
    <div id="a3" class="red part-typeA3 green"></div>

    <!-- A View is specified by 
          @part-view or
          classname part-<TYPE>-<VIEW> 
            (the type must match the Part)

        A View _must_ be specified as a direct child of a Part
        (you can't define a Part and a PartView on the
        same element)
    -->

    <div id="b" part="typeB">
      <div id="b1" part-view="viewB1"></div>
      <div id="b2" class="red part-view-viewB2 green"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="d" part-type="partA">
      <div id="d2" part-view="viewA">
        This is Part #d with view viewA
      </div>
      <!-- #d2 has type="partA" and view="viewA" -->
    </div>

    <div id="f" part-type="partF">
      <div>
        <div id="f2" part-view="viewF2">
          This is an error (or something unexpected
          by the system) -- Views must be defined
          by direct children of Parts.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- PART OPTIONS 
    
          You can pass options to a Part upon creation through
          the @part-options attribute.

          The value is basically a JSON object, minus the 
          surrounding {  }.
    -->

    <div id="e" 
      part="typeE-viewE" 
      part-options="this: 2, is: 'a', 'set of options': [3,4,5]"></div>

    <!-- Part references 
    
          A Part can gets its ID from @id - and if it also defines a Phase, then
          it shares an ID (which is OK because it only has be unique among Parts)
    -->

    <!-- Part and Phase have ID #i1 -->

    <div id="i1" part-type="typeI" phase-type="seq"></div>

    <!-- If you want the ID to be different for the Part, use the @part-id attribute 
         (here the Part has ID #j2, while Phase has #j1)
    -->

    <div id="j1" part-type="typeJ1" phase-type="seq" part-id="j2"></div>

    <!-- If you want the Phase to apply to a Part _previously defined_, 
         then use the @part-ref attribute -->

    <div id="k1" phase-begin="3s" part-ref="#j2"></div>
